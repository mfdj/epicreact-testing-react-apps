    * Repo setup [#1](https://github.com/mfdj/epicreact-testing-react-apps/pull/1)
    * Read But really, [what is a JavaScript Test?](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/but-really-what-is-a-javascript-test) and [what is a JavaScript Mock?](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/but-really-what-is-a-javascript-mock) which are both classic KCD "from the ground up" intros
